                                    <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
                                    <p class="font-italic">The video below will give you a brief introduction into data types.</p>
                                    <p>The 6 main data types we will be learning are the integer, double,
                                    string, character, boolean, and short. These will be the 6 main data types you will see.</p>
                                    <img src = "assets/img/dataType.png" alt = "" class = "img-fluid">
                                    <p>The picture above shows how to declare and intialize data types. </p>
                                    <p><b>Integer:</b> The integer is declared and initialized by the
                                    key word <b>int</b>. The integer is used to store any integer
                                    that can be stored with at most 32 bits.</p>
                                    <p><b>Short:</b> The short is similar to the integer except,
                                    that it only uses 16 bits of memory, which means it will not
                                    be able to store as large numbers as an integer. The short is defined
                                    by the key word <b>short</b> and is used to optimize memory.</p>
                                    <p><b>Double:</b> The double is used to display decimals
                                    and can display larger numbers than the integer. The double is
                                    declared and initialized with the keyword <b>double</b>.</p>
                                    <p><b>Character:</b>The character data type is used mainly with encoding
                                    and can be used in various situations. The character data type can store
                                    any single letter character such as a or B as well as integers. The
                                    keyword for character declaration is <b>char</b>. It is important to note
                                    that the character a and A are not the same in Java because these 2
                                    characters correspond to 2 different Ascii values. Also when initializing a character variable
                                    you must use the single quotes as shown above.</p>
                                    <p><b>Boolean:</b> The boolean is the easiest data type to understand. The boolean is
                                        characterized by the keyword <b>boolean</b> and can either equal true or false.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><b>String:</b> The String is slightly different from the other data types, because
                                    it is a non-primitive data type, but it is used very often in Computer Science. The
                                    keyword for declaring a string is <b>String</b>. With strings the S should be capitalized
                                    because the String is treated like an object. For the data types mentioned above the
                                    first letter in the keyword has to be lowercase. The differentiation between the String
                                    and the other data types is whatever value is used in the variable will be in double quotes, and you can
                                    have any value or character within these double quotes.</p>

                                    <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                                    <p class="font-italic"> In this lesson we will be going over the conditional statements
                                    which include the: if statement, for-loop, and while loop.</p>
                                    <p>The video below will give you a brief introduction into conditionals.</p>
                                    <img src = "assets/img/if.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The <b>if statement</b> is the main conditional statement that allows you
                                    to compare 2 different values or variables. The syntax for an if statement is shown
                                    above.</p>
                                    <img src = "assets/img/while.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The <b>while loop</b> is a loop that will run until a certain condition has been met.
                                    It is important to check the contents within the while loop in order to make sure that
                                    there is an eventual break in the loop. The syntax for a while loop is shown above.</p>
                                    <img src = "assets/img/for.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The final conditional we will be learning is the <b>for loop</b>, which is similar to the while loop,
                                    except that the extent to which the loop is already defined within the argument. The
                                    syntax for a for loop is shown above and is used in many situations from arrays to binary
                                    search.</p>

                                    <p>In the video below, we will go over an introduction into arrays. Also if you scroll

                                    <p class="font-italic">In Java an array is a simple data structure
                                    with a fixed size and can store more than one element. The declaration and size of an
                                    array will be shown below. It is recommended that you understand for loops and while
                                    loops before starting arrays.</p>

                                    <p>The picture above provides the introduction to declaring and initializing an array.</p>
                                    <p>The first line shows how to declare an array. The first part will be the data type
                                    and the second part will be the name of the array. It is important that the brackets
                                    are included, either after the data type or after the array name. The bolded data type can be replaced
                                    with any data type and even objects as long as it matches the data types of all the elements in the array.</p>
                                    <p>The second and third line shows how to instantiate an array by allocating memory for it.
                                        The instantiation process is similar to declaring, except there is now an equals sign, and
                                        you have to specify the word new followed by the data type and then the brackets. The brackets
                                        have to contain an integer so that memory can be allocated. The third line shows how to manually
                                        place values into an array and the table shows the length of arr. In arrays, the first index
                                        is always referred to as index 0, and the last index will always be one less than the array length.
                                        One thing that will be touched on in the picture below which is how to obtain the length
                                        of the array, which is done by using the syntax array.length, where the word array
                                        is replaced by the name that you give to the array you are referring to.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The picture above shows how to use a for loop in order to traverse an array.
                                    The value of i starts at 0, because the first index in an array is 0, and will
                                    stop after iterating with the value 1 less than the array length. Also make sure
                                    the less than symbol is used in the for loop, or else you will receive an array
                                    outofBounds error. </p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">The video below will give you a brief introduction into Strings.</p>
                                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSbdrPrs-Sw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                    <p>The picture below shows how strings are broken down. It is similar to arrays, but
                                        not exactly the same. When we break up strings we put the break between 2 characters.
                                        So we would say that the F is between the 0 and 1 index.</p>
                                    <img src= "assets/img/Strings0.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The picture below shows all the various methods associated with
                                    Strings. The first method you will see is the <b>.length()</b> method, and
                                    remember Strings are treated like objects so you have to include the parentheses.
                                    The next method is the <b>.substring</b> method which has 2 different forms. The form
                                    on line 10 will print every number right of the line 3. So we would write Google, and
                                    make breaks similar to what we did in the first picture. This would print out gle.
                                    The substring method on line 11 will print out the characters between index line 3 and index line 5,
                                    so that line will print out gl. Then the <b>indexOf</b> method is a little more tricky
                                    as indices are not as restrictive as they are in arrays. So the indexOf method will return
                                    the line before the instance of the character or phrase you are looking for. Since gl occurs
                                    after index line 3, the indexOf method will return 3. The next 2 methods we will cover are the
                                    most commonly used methods in all of Strings. The first one is the <b>.equals</b> method
                                    which is meant to compare 2 strings and see if they are equal. The other method is the
                                    <b>.toCharArray</b>, which will turn the string into an array of characters. Also in
                                    line 23 I show how to turn a character array into a string. The final method is the
                                    <b>.concat</b> method which allows you to combine multiple strings.</p>

                                    <img src= "assets/img/Strings1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The picture below shows how to print out a String, while using the
                                    substring method. This is the method you can use if you want to utilize a for-loop,
                                    in order to access each character in the String.</p>

                                    <p>The final piece of code is just an example to help display a combination of
                                    methods that can be used on Strings. This piece of code does employ some understanding of methods,
                                        but can be done without using methods. The goal of this code is to take a string
                                        and take the last n letters in that String and repeat those n letters n times.
                                        The code below shows teh implementation behind that problem.

                                    <p>The pciture below shows the syntax behind methods. <b>Methods</b> are blocks of code
                                    that take in a specific parameter in order to manipulate or carry out a specific task.
                                    In order for a method to run, they have to be called upon. This is shown in the picture above
                                    where the function <b>findMean</b> is called within the main method. Methods are important
                                    because they provide structure to your code.</p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">The video below will provide a brief introduction into ArrayLists.
                                    ArrayLists is a resizable array in Java that is capable of storing objects. An ArrayList
                                    is much more versatile than an array because elements can be removed and added from
                                    an ArrayList.</p>
                                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zx0uNAlOxI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                    <img src="assets/img/arraylist1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    The video above shows the 2 key components of the arraylist. First, in order to use an
                                    ArrayList you must import <b>java.util.ArrayList</b>. The next lines show how to declare
                                    ArrayLists depending on the data type they contain. It is important that the first letter in
                                    the data types are capitalized because an ArrayList stores objects. That is
                                    why there are parentheses after the declaration.
                                    <img src="assets/img/arraylist2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The 6 main methods associated with ArrayLists are shown above. Each method will be broken down
                                        below.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><b>Add Method:</b> The add method can be used in 2 different scenarios. The first line
                                    shows the add method adding a value into the array. In this case the value will always
                                    be added to the end of the array. The second type of add method accepts 2 arguments. The first
                                        argument represents the index and the second argument represents the value. As a result,
                                        the value will be added to the specified index in the ArrayList and all the values at or after
                                        that index will automatically shift to the right.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><b>Remove Method:</b>The remove method takes in one parameter. The parameter within
                                    the remove method refers to the value in that particular index. The method will remove
                                    the value in the index and shift all of the values to the left.</p>
                                    <p><b>Set Method:</b>The set method allows you to change the value of a specific index.
                                    The set method requires 2 parameters, the first parameter is the index we will be accessing
                                    and the second parameter is the new value that will be placed into the index.</p>
                                    <p><b>Get method:</b>The get method allows you to access a specific value in an index. This can
                                    be useful when printing a specific value from the ArrayList.</p>
                                    <p>One of the methods shown in the picture below is the <b>ArrayList.size()</b> method
                                    and is the equivalent to the functionality of array.length when we were doing arrays.
                                    It is important that when traversing through an ArrayList you use the size method.</p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">The video below will provide a brief introduction into Objects and Classes.
                                    Classes and Objects have any impact on all the code you write in Java. The object
                                    is something that has features and is made up of data and variable input. The class
                                    is what we use in order to create those objects. The video below will
                                    provide you with a basic understanding of these concepts.</p>

                                    <p>An object would be a car, because there are specific attributes that define a car
                                    such as brand, type of fuel, or type of car.</p>


                                    <p>Below is the syntax used for a class. In it we see syntax known as
                                        setters and getters. This process is used in <b>encapsulation</b> because we
                                    want to hide what we are doing from the user in the case that we are handling
                                    sensitive data such as password or ID number. This makes sure that
                                    our data can only be accessed within that particular class. In this scenario,
                                        the <b>get method</b> will return a value or output and the <b>set method</b> will allow
                                    you to change or set a value.</p>

                                    <p>The picture below shows the main method, which is in a different class, and how
                                    we can access and manipulate an object when we are operating in a different class.</p>

                                    <p>The picture below shows the syntax behind a constructor in the Car Class and
                                    the syntax we will use in the main method to create a car object. A <b>Constructor</b>
                                    is used to initialize an object, and it has no return value which makes
                                    it easier to set initial values for an Object. In the main, you will create an object
                                    using the constructor.</p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">Inheritance is one of the main subsets
                                    of Objects and Classes. Inheritance is the process of one class
                                    taking on the properties of another class. The class that inherits
                                    the properties of another class is called the subclass, and the
                                    main class who has its properties and methods being inherited is
                                    the super class.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/inheritance.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>What you see above is the implementation of code in order to
                                    show the syntax behind Inheritance. Inheritance is denoted by the
                                    keyword <b>extends</b>. The Calculate class is the parent/super class
                                    and the Maths class is the child/sub class. This means that the object
                                    in the Maths class inherits the properties of the parent class, which means
                                    that even if we create an object in the Maths class it can still access the methods
                                    in the Calculate class. However, there is one thing to note if you create an object
                                    from class Calculate you <b>cannot</b> invoke the multiplication method, because
                                    the multiplication method is only part of the child(Maths) class. This means that
                                    the parent class cannot inherit methods and properties from the subclass.</p>
                                    <p>Another keyword you will see in inheritance is <b>super</b>. This keyword is used
                                    when you have a method with the same name in both the parent class and sub class, but
                                    these methods have different return values or print statements. If you want to
                                    invoke the method of the parent class you use the keyword <b>(super.)</b> before the
                                    method name.</p>

                                    <h3>Multi-Dimensional Arrays</h3>
                                    <p class="font-italic">Multi-Dimensional Arrays are known as arrays within
                                    arrays. Just like arrays, multi-dimensional arrays start off at index 0.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/2dfirst.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The picture above is meant to show a visual example of a 2-D array.
                                    The 2-D array is defined by the number of rows and columns so this array
                                    would be a 4 x 5 array because there are 4 rows and 5 columns. </p>

                                    <p>The image above shows how to initialize a 2-D array.
                                One of the important things to note with a 2-D array is that not every
                                row will have the same number of columns. As you can see with the
                                2-D array called <b>box</b> there are a different amount of values in
                                        each row. However, when we use the syntax <b>box.length</b> the result will be the number of
                                    rows in the 2-D array.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/2d3.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">

                                    <p>The picture above shows how to traverse through a 2-D array.
                                    In the picture we use the nexted for loop, which is a for loop
                                    within a for loop in order to traverse through the grid. In the
                                    second for loop, we use <b>i < box[i].length</b>. This will give
                                    you the amount of columns in the row, and it is safer to use this
                                    syntax, because as mentioned above there are certain cases where the
                                    2-D array may not have the same number of columns from 1 row to the next.</p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">Binary Search or linear search is a well-known
                                        algorithm used in Java that takes an array that has been sorted
                                        and finds a specific value within that array by shrinking the
                                        search interval.</p>
                                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgPkj6e6Lts" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                    <p>The goal of binary search is to optimize the search process.
                                    There is always a chance that the number we are looking for is at the end
                                    of an array, and binary search creates a faster method to find this number.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/show.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">

                                    <p>The picture above shows a visual example of binary search when we are looking for the
                                    number. As you can see the search interval is growing smaller, which is how we find the number
                                    that we are looking for which is 22.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/itera.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The picture above shows the code needed to execute the binary search.
                                    This way is through the use of a for loop, and in our syntax the value of start
                                    and end change depending on where the number is located. One important thing to note is that
                                    in order for binary search to be used the array we are using must be <b>sorted</b>.</p>

                                    to locate the value.</p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">Sorting is a concept we touched on in the previous section,
                                    but is slightly more complicated. The process of sorting utilizes code in order to
                                    arrange data.</p>
                                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pg-qUUPr72g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                                    <p>The whole point of sorting is to make sure we can organize our data, but a big part
                                    of sorting is optimization. In order to sort we use algorithms. There are many algorithms
                                    that are widely used, but in this lesson we will go over the 3 you will see the most often.
                                    These algorithms are created in order to optimize run-time and memory, making it easier
                                    for your computer to run these programs.</p>

                                    <img src="assets/img/bubble.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p><b>Bubblesort</b> is the simplest sorting method we will see in Java. Bubblesort
                                    looks at 2 adjacent numbers in an array and swaps them if the second element
                                    is less than the first element. The program will keep going through this list until
                                    it doesn't have to swap any more values.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/select.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p><b>Selection Sort</b> is the more common sorting method used by students. In
                                    a selection sort we have the original array and the new, empty array. We go through
                                    the original array and find the minimum and take out that value from the original array,
                                    and put it into the new array. Then we continue this process until all the values in
                                    the original array have been moved and sorted in the new array.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/quick.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The final sorting method we will be going over is the <b>Quicksort</b>.
                                    The quicksort is the most optimized algorithm out of the 3 we are learning in
                                    this section. With this method of sorting we take a specific/break point in
                                    the list and we determine all the values that are greater and smaller than
                                    the value in the break point. The Quicksort method is built around this break/pivot point,
                                        and in the code above we use the recursive implementation of the Quicksort. In the implementation above we use
                                    the last value in the array as a break point, and it is recommended that you use either
                                    the start or end point as your break point to make it easier to manage the code.</p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">Recursion is a subsection of methods, and involves calling
                                    a method within that same method.</p>
                                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDgh-93Hwvk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                    <p>The key for understanding Recursion are 2 pieces. The first piece is the
                                    <b>base case</b>. The base case is the stopping condition or the statement that
                                        tells the program when to stop. The second piece is the <b>iterative step</b>, or
                                    the part that tells the program to keep progressing.</p>

                                    <p>The above picture shows a step-by-step example of how to understand
                                    a problem centered around recursion. It goes line by line to understand
                                    each step performed by the program.</p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/code.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>This would be an example piece of code that would print the sum of
                                    numbers from 1 to n. In this case n would be 4. This code would progress
                                    until the base case of n = 1 is reached.</p>

                                    <p class="font-italic">This section will cover a miscellaneous topic
                                        covered in AP Computer Science, which is the topic of
                                        hexadecimal and binary numbers.</p>
                                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JexvzPZ7kHc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                    <p>Hexadecimal also referred to base 16 numbers are represented by characters from
                                    0 to F. Binary is representing numbers and values through 1s and 0s. Decimal is the common
                                    set of numbers we see in everyday life such as 10, 100, and 4500. </p>
                                    <img src="assets/img/bin.JPG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>The picture above shows the process of converting hexadecimal to decimal(top), and decimal
                                    to hexadecimal(bottom). In the top problem we are turning hexadecimal into decimal. When doing this
                                    we have to remember that each individual value is some value multiplied by 16 to a certain power.
                                    You always start at 16 to the power of 0 for the rightmost value, which in this case is C. Then
                                    you use the table on the right to see which value is associated with C(12), and you multiply 12 by 16^0.
                                    Then you move to the left to the next character, except this time we will be multiplying the value
                                    represnted by 5 by 16 to the power of 1. If we continue this series we will get 3676.
                                    When turning any base in this case base 16 to decimal, you keep dividing
                                    until the number at the bottom left of this operation is less than the number you are dividing by.
                                    In this case the bottom left number is 5, which is less than 16 so we know that this is the
                                    stopping point. Then we record every number from that 5,so we go to the right and then go up
                                    and record all the remainders. In this case there is only 1 remainder(10) so we have 5 and 10. Now
                                        we have to represent the 5 and 10 in hexadecimal so we get 5A.</p>
                                   

                                    <img src="assets/img/hexa.JPG" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                                    <p>Turning binary into decimal and vice versa is similar to what we did above.
                                    For the left problem we are turning 25 in base 10 to binary. Since we are converting a decimal
                                    into another base we take the number given and keep dividing by the base we want to convert it to.
                                    Since binary is base 2, we keep dividing 25 by 2 until we get a quotient of 1. As you can see
                                    in the chain we stop at 1 and we record 1 and all the remainders that came before getting that 1.
                                    In this case it is important to note that 0 is a remainder and <b>Must</b> be recorded. When going from
                                    binary to decimal, we know that the rightmost number represents 2 to the power of 0. That power
                                    increases by 1 for each numbers to the left. This scenario is much easier because only the spots that
                                    contain a 1 are recorded so we only have to add 2 to the power of 3 with 2 to the power of 0, because
                                    those are the only spots where there is a 1. In binary there are only 2 possible values, that
                                    being 1 and 0, so we don't have to worry about any extra values such as those in hexadecimal.</p>

                                    Thank you so much for your cooperation.</p>

                                    <p>There are many resources you can still practice on for the AP Computer Science test.
                                    I also recommend using codingBat and solving the problems on those websites as well.</p>
